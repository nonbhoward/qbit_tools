# TODO top bugs
    1. search rank soft-lock
    2. conclusion state never reached
    3. search parser not tracking added result count
    4. add_result adds to expected_add_count - 1 instead of expected_add_count

..focusing on program function  # TODO document current efforts
    1. implement add_mode, rename to add_state?
    2. implement size filters
    3. maximize results by framing section header terms as permutations bookended AND delimited by permissive regex aka .*

..focusing on program organization  # TODO document current efforts
    1. delete unused functions
    2. refactor parsers/keys as globally scoped?

COMPLETED
    1. prioritize searches based on when they were last-run
    1. make sure getters handle all key/parser fetches
    2. make sure setters handle all key/parser fetches

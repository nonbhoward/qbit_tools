# TODO top bugs, sorted by priority
    0. search queueing and search rank is fucked
    1. search rank soft-lock
    3. search parser not tracking added result count
    4. add_result adds to expected_add_count - 1 instead of expected_add_count

..focusing on program function  # TODO document current efforts
    1. implement add_mode, rename to add_state?
    2. implement size filters
    3. maximize results by framing section header terms as permutations bookended AND delimited by permissive regex aka .*

..focusing on program organization  # TODO document current efforts
    0. extend settings_wrapper with functions that return built classes based on args..
        poorly worded but it's enough breadcrumbs to remember to re-visit this
    1. delete unused functions
    2. refactor parsers/keys as globally scoped?
        tried, created recursion & organization issues, have to re-think..
        ..this is still the biggest problem & biggest opportunity to learn

COMPLETED
    0. after adding a single result, the processing code crashes
        bug fix in place, testing, suspect it was the rogue return
    1. prioritize searches based on when they were last-run
    1. make sure getters handle all key/parser fetches
    2. make sure setters handle all key/parser fetches
    2. conclusion state never reached
        bug fix may be in place, same as for 0, testing
    5. interpolation issue with configparser
	bug fix in place, testing

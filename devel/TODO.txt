[TODO SECTION]
	TODOs focusing on program function  # TODO document current efforts
		-5. remove concluded results from search ranking algo
		-4. implement a metadata statistics section that reports count, stats, etc
		-3. instead of update search states so freely, increment or reset only
		-2. set required minimum values in EDIT_SETTINGS_HERE.cfg
		-1. draw a block diagram of module relationships
		00. could check against added results and prevent attempting to add them again, spamming the log
		+1. maximize results by framing section header terms as permutations bookended AND delimited by permissive regex aka .*
		+2. implement avg seed count
	TODOs focusing on program organization  # TODO document current efforts
		00. extend settings_wrapper with function calls to replace keyring concept
		+1. delete unused functions
[BUG SECTION]
	BUGS, DOCUMENTED (each section sorted by priority)
		-2. search rank soft-lock
			search rank + conclusion state do not play well together
		-1. not all children of Exception have message attribute.. 
		00. sometimes add_result adds two results for one magnet..
			..causing a desync with the metadata parser
		+1. add_result adds to expected_add_count - 1 instead of expected_add_count
		+2. on program conclusion, the search.cfg is not updated before exit() is called
			..could cause confusion, but doesn't matter functionally
	BUGS, IN TESTING
	       -1. search_attempt_count is incrementing too often
			fix in place, resolved?
		+0. metadata parsers aren't always building section names
			resolved, function overlap
		+0. resolve optionality for result filtering and how to handle defaults
			resolved by adding function state_machine_interface.filter_provided_by_
		+1. work out metadata read/write
			believe this is resolved
		+1. implement add_mode, rename to add_state? renamed to add_paused
		+2. refactor parsers/keys as globally scoped? success
			this was a large milestone
		+2. conclusion state never reached
			bug fix may be in place, same as for 0, testing
		+5. interpolation issue with configparser
			bug fix in place, testing
	BUG LOG, RESOLVED
		-2. after processing results, searches are not re-queued
		-1. after 10 failed attempts, search processing stops
		00. after adding a single result, the processing code crashes
			bug fix in place, testing, suspect it was the rogue return
		00. search queueing and search rank is fucked
		00. results added count does it work?
		+1. prioritize searches based on when they were last-run
		+1. make sure getters handle all key/parser fetches
		+2. make sure setters handle all key/parser fetches
		+2. implement size filters

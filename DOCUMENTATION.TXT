                    b. search
                iv. uses following parsers to fetch environment variables

[STATE MACHINE NOTES]
    search states : queued, running, stopped, concluded
    1. queued
        when to go to 2? start_search -> search_status = RUNNING
        when to go to 3? never?
        when to go to 4? never?
    2. running
        when to go to 1? if bad data, reset to 1
        when to go to 3? search_status = STOPPED
        when to go to 4? never?
    3. stopped
        when to go to 1? if bad results or no results, reset to 1
        when to go to 2? never?
        when to go to 4? if exceed user thresholds
    4. concluded
        by design, NEVER EXIT THIS STATE..
        ..must manual override via configuration

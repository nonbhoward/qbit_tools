[STATE MACHINE NOTES]
	the state machine has..
		two actions : increment, reset  
		four states : queued, running, stopped, concluded. queued and concluded are user-defined, running and stopped are api-defined

    states and transitions
        1. queued
            	when to go to 2? start_search -> search_status = RUNNING
            	when to go to 3? it should be impossible to go to state 3 from 1
            	when to go to 4? it should be impossible to go to state 4 from 1
        2. running
            	when to go to 1? if bad (or no) data is returned from a search results fetch, reset to 1
            	when to go to 3? search_status = STOPPED
            	when to go to 4? it should be impossible to go to state 4 from 2
        3. stopped
		when to go to 1? if bad (or no) data is returned from a search results fetch, reset to 1
		when to go to 2? it should be impossible to go from state 3 to 2
		when to go to 4? if the thresholds set in searches.cfg are met for that search header
        4. concluded

        metadata_added.cfg is added results history
        metadata_failed.cfg is non-added results history
    data_search
        search.cfg is a list of user-configured searches and state-data

    qbit_interface
        api_comm.py is minimal code to interact with the api
    user_configuration
        EDIT_SETTINGS_HERE.cfg is global settings, currently RO, edit before runtime
        settings_io.py is the central hub for parser interactions
        settings_wrapper.py is a parser-wrapping class hierarchy
    .gitignore is self-explanatory
    DOCUMENTATION.TXT is YOU ARE HERE
    LICENSE is self-explanatory
    main_loop.py is the abstracted application function
    README.md is self-explanatory
    state_machine.py is minimal code to manage the state machine
    state_machine_interface.py is helper functions for the state machine
	functions
	1. offloads code from the state machine module, keeping it simple
	2. offloads code from the api comm module, keeping it simple
	3. is the go-to location for fetching parser data, communicates.. 
		..directly and often with the settings_io module
    TODO.txt is project notes, known bugs and a good place to start.. 
	..when looking for work

[STATE MACHINE NOTES]
    all search states
        queued, running, stopped, concluded
            queued and concluded are user-defined, running and stopped are api-defined

    states and transitions
        1. queued
            when to go to 2? start_search -> search_status = RUNNING
            when to go to 3? never
            when to go to 4? never
        2. running
            when to go to 1? if bad data, reset to 1
            when to go to 3? search_status = STOPPED
            when to go to 4? never
        3. stopped
            when to go to 1? if bad results or no results, reset to 1
            when to go to 2? never
            when to go to 4? if exceed user thresholds
        4. concluded
            once entered, never exit
